## What is it?

C'mon (/kəˈmɔn/) is a general library for the Go Programming Language.  
Its spirit is the same as [Heirloom Toolchest's
``libcommon/``](https://github.com/Projeto-Pindorama/heirloom-ng/tree/master/libcommon).  
Still work in progress. Meant to be used in many projects, from
[pacote](https://github.com/Projeto-Pindorama/pacote) to the L.E.``mount``
rewrite in Go.
